## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
### What I learned

This challenge was a good opportunity for me to test my HTML and CSS skills. I used flexbox to design the card and align the items inside, I used css grid once inside the card, to align the music icon and annual plan, I thought it was faster. I look forward to taking my skills to the next level with another challenge.

### Continued development

I am still not comfortable with mobile design, I want to work on it more and as I mostly used flexbox in this challenge, I want to use css grid more in the next challenge while adding some Javascript and animation to the webpage.
